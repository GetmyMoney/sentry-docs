In most cases, sending all transactions to Sentry would generate more data than you could use and would use up your events quota too quickly. Sentry provides tools to control the _type_ and _amount_ of transactions that are monitored. This allows you to have transaction data that's actionable and meaningful and to manage your quotas if you're on an event-quota based plan. Applying the proper SDK configuration is an iterative and on-going process, but these tips will show you how to best use Sentry's tools to get the most out of your transaction events.

## 1. SDK Filtering: beforeSend

All Sentry SDKs support the `beforeSend` callback method. Once implemented, the method is invoked when the SDK captures an event, right before sending it to your Sentry account. It receives the event object as a parameter, so you can use that to modify the event's data or drop it completely (by returning `null`) based on your custom logic and the data available on the event like _tags_, _environment_, _release version_, and so on. For more information see [Filtering Events](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/filtering/)

## 2. SDK Configuration: Tracing Options

When you configure your the SDK, you can control the number of transactions that are sent to Sentry by setting the [tracing options](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/option/#tracing-options). You can also set up [custom instrumentation](/platform-redirect/?next=/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/) for performance monitoring so you can capture certain types of transactions.

## 3. Event Usage Stats {#common-workflows-for-managing-your-event-stream}

Once you've completed the steps above, you can look at your events in aggregate in the Stats > Usage Stats page to answer some key questions like:

What's the breakdowndown of my incoming events?
Which projects are consuming my quota?
Which issues are consuming my quota?

The answers to these questions can help you figure out where you need to do further fine-tuning of your filters, limits, or SDK configuration.

### > **How can I see a breakdown of incoming events?**

[Usage Stats](/product/stats/#usage-stats) displays details about the total number of events Sentry has received across your entire organization for up to 90 days. The report breaks down the events by project into three categories:

- **Accepted**: Events processed and displayed in your event stream.
- **Dropped**: Events that were discarded due to a limit being hit.
- **Filtered**: Events that were blocked based on your inbound filter rules.

Clicking on the settings icon next to the project name will open the project's settings page where you can manage its Inbound Filters and Rate Limits.

You can also download monthly reports with a similar breakdown of all your previous billing periods under **Settings > Subscription** in the "Usage History" tab.

### > **What are my busiest projects?**

Our billing system provides a report on usage that you can export as a .csv file. That file lists the quota consumed by each project in your organization.

### > **What issues are consuming my quota?**

The Sentry workflow starts with a real-time alert notifying you about an error in your code. If you want to take a more proactive approach to resolve your busiest issues, you can set up a query in **Discover**. When you're building the query, set the columns as shown below:

Once the changes are applied, the "Results" table displays your busiest issues:
