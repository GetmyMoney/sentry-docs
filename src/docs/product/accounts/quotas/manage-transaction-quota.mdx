Sending all application errors to Sentry ensures you'll be notified in real-time when errors occur in your code. However, with just the basic setup, you might quickly realize that your applications generate many errors, and those might trigger many notifications. Sentry provides tools to control the _type_ and _amount_ of errors that are monitored. These will allow you to:

1. Shape your event stream to make it actionable and meaningful.
2. Reserve those real-time notifications for errors that actually break your code.
3. Manage your quotas if you're on an event-quota based plan.

## 1. SDK Filtering: beforeSend

All Sentry SDKs support the `beforeSend` callback method. Once implemented, the method is invoked when the SDK captures an event, right before sending it to your Sentry account. It receives the event object as a parameter, so developers can use that to modify the event's data or drop it completely (by returning `null`) based on their custom logic and the data available on the event like _tags_, _environment_, _release version_, _error attributes_, and so forth. For more information see [Filtering Events](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/filtering/)

## 2. SDK Configuration

The Sentry SDKs have several configuration options that can be used to filter unwanted errors from leaving your application's runtime. A lot of these options are platform-specific, so make sure you look for yours in our docs under [Platforms](/platforms/) and [Configuration](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/). Here are some examples:
